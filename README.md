# The O, Omega, and Theta

Each row in the table below specifies two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$.
Fill in the *number* from this list that best describes their relationship:

1. $f(n)\in O(g(n))$, but $f(n)\not \in \Omega(g(n))$
1. $f(n)\in \Omega(g(n))$, but $f(n)\not \in O(g(n))$
1. $f(n)\not\in O(g(n))$, and $f(n)\not \in \Omega(g(n))$
1. $f(n)\in \Theta (g(n))$

I have done the first one for you, as an example.

| $f(n)=\ldots$              | compared to | $g(n)=\ldots$          |
|----------------------------|:-----------:|------------------------|
| $f(n)=n$                   | 1           | $g(n)=2n^2 + n$        |
| $f(n)= 10n + 3\log_{15} n$ | 1           | $g(n)= 4n - 2\log_2 n$ |
| $f(n) = 2n^5$              | 2           | $g(n) = 5n^2$          |
| $f(n)=\log_{10} \left(n^{10}\right)$ | 2 | $g(n)=n$ |
| $f(n)= 4n^5 $ | 2 | $g(n)= 5n^4$ |
| $f(n) = 10^{256}$ | 3 | $g(n) = \log n$ |
| $f(n)= n^2 $ | 4 | $g(n)= 2^n$ |



Big O is the upper bound on an algorithm and is used to define the worst case scenario of an algorithm's run time. Like less than.

Big Omega is the lower bound on an algorithm and is used to define the best case scenario of an algorithm's run time. Like greater than.

Big Theta is the exact runtime of an algorithm.

I spoke with fellow student Lily Brongo about this to help with my understanding of big O, big Theta, and big Omega.

I used this GeeksforGeeks page to get the basic definitions of big O, big Theta, and big Omega. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-big-oh-big-omega-and-big-theta/#
